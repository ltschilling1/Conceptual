**Considerations for Joint Planning**

Collaborative assessment planning is an effective approach to ensuring that the assessment will be useful for decision-making. Strengthening scientist-decision maker partnerships creates opportunities for applying research findings to improve ocean health.

•	Create a work plan that has research and management objectives

•	Align research with policy issues to ensure all parties are pursuing the same objectives

•	Share timeline of the study – availability of results, critical decision-making dates (budgets, planning, etc.) – releasing findings strategically can increase impact

•	Identify sources of high quality information and data

•	Plan communications to make the information accessible to stakeholders and various decision-makers

•	Funding strategy should include short and long term planning for science, communication, and action

•	Fundraise with decision-makers: Align research with policy issues to ensure both parties are pursuing the same objectives

•	Articulate the agreed plans in writing (scientists also share a research plan)

•	Create a budget that includes a communications component to cover costs of nationally disseminating findings: providing briefings about findings and applications of if the Index to agencies, decision-makers, and managers who will use the Index

•	Allocate ~fifteen% of the budget to science outreach and communications; travel, time, meeting costs, planning, production of materials
