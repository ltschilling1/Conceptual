**Understanding Status**The status component of each goal is captured through a model that represents the philosophy of the goal in a way that produces findings that are most useful to inform decision-making at the scale of the assessment.The current status of each goal is determined by comparing the most recent measure of the goal with a goal-specific sustainable reference point. The reference point may be a target value at some time in the past, comparison with some other location, a target previously established by a treaty or other agreement, or – best of all – a target determined by an accepted input-output equation (also called a production function). For each goal, as well as for many individual data layers, values are rescaled to reference points, or targets, which serve as benchmarks based on SMART principles: Specific (to the management goal), Measurable, Ambition, Realistic, and Time-bound (Samhouri et al. two thousand twelve; Perrings et al. two thousand ten, two thousand eleven).
