**Understand the Philosophy Behind the Framework**

Before conducting your own assessment it is important that you understand the philosophy behind the Index. In order to do so, one must carefully read through the methods, a copy of which can be found [here](www.oceanhealthindex.org/About/Methods/). We have also created a conceptual guide which can be found [here](www.ohi-science.org)

Below are several documents and materials that we have also created to support this important step.

  - Ocean Health Index Assessment Fact sheet
  - A Guide to Planning Assessments and Informing Decision Making
  - Prologue to the Assessment Documents
  - The Ocean Health Index Conceptual Guide & Highlights
  - The Ocean Health Index Toolbox Application Manual

All guides can be found at [www.ohi-science.org](www.ohi-science.org)
