**Adaptive Management**

“If the Index were adopted as a management tool, recalculating scores regularly could reveal whether management actions had the intended effect on both overall ocean health and particular goals” (Halpern et al two thousand fourteen).

Findings will help inform decision-makers about management actions and policies. However, understanding the effect of management actions requires iterative studies. Repeated assessments are also necessary to continuously adapt management strategies.

A repeatable process of Index assessments will need to establish to determine how well the management interventions are accomplishing the established targets.

Management plans must include a thorough mechanism to track any changes related to the regional assessments activities.

Through this process, the design, management, and monitoring of the project should be used to continually gather information on the effectiveness of its decision-making process. As information is gathered and assessed, it is possible to recommend policy and management reforms as needed, providing a flexible decision-making process that constantly improves.

This will provide key information to decision-makers so they can adapt their management strategies over time, in a way that increasingly moves closer to the target.

Continuous monitoring of the strategy will also help improve resource allocation, so the strategies remain cost-effective.
