**Understanding Pressures**Pressures are the sum of the ecological and social pressures that negatively affect goal scores. The Index framework calculates pressures by first grouping them into five ecological categories (pollution, habitat destruction, fishing pressure, species pollution, and climate change) and one social category. The reason behind the ecological categories was designed to minimize sampling bias. Ecological and social pressures are assessed separately and then combined with equal weighting, which could be changed if there is local information on how to do so.Goals often interact with each other through pressures. The pressure created by one goal may affect a second goal without being affected itself. For example, raising fish in the mariculture goal can cause genetic escapes, which is a pressure. This pressure affects only the wild-caught fisheries and species sub-goals but does not affect mariculture itself.
