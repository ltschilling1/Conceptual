**Artisanal Opportunities**

This goal captures whether people with the desire to fish on small scales have the opportunity to do so. It is important to capture the degree to which a region permits or encourages artisanal fishing compared to the demand for such fishing opportunities, and if possible, the sustainability of artisanal fishing practices.

The artisanal fishing opportunities goal measures the opportunities for artisanal fishing rather than the amount of fish caught (covered in the food provision goal) or the household revenue earned (covered in the livelihoods and economies goal). Higher scores reflect high potential for the local population to access ocean resources, regardless of whether or not they actually do. This goal is about access: economic access (need and costs involved), physical access (how possible it is for individuals to get to the resource), and access to the fish themselves (how robust fish populations are). The opportunity ot fish artisanally interacts with other goals when damaging practices are used (e.g. cyanide or dynamite fishing).

Ideally, this goal would include some measure of how easy or hard it is for people to access ocean resources when they need them and an assessment of the (un)sustainability of harvest of all nearshore stocks used by artisanal fishermen. The type of reference point used will depend on the data available.
