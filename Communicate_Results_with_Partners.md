**Communicate Results with Partners and Others**

It is important to begin your communications with a strategy. The first thing you’ll want to do is go back to your [stakeholder analysis](link to conducting a stakeholder analysis section), breaking your stakeholders up into different groups. A good way to group your stakeholders is by their objectives. Think about the different needs of each group of your stakeholders. What information does each group need from you to meet their objectives or to perform your desired action/outcome? These groups should include decision makers, funders, the general public/news outlets, as well as other stakeholders that are important to your assessment. The quickest way to create these groups is to look back at your [stakeholder management sheet](http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newPPM_08.htm).

Once you have identified your different groups and clarified the objectives for each, begin brainstorming different channels you can use for your communications and sorting them by which would be most appropriate for each group. For example, stakeholders involved in decision making and planning that you would like to help engage in informed management actions would be more receptive to a well-laid out report rather than a newsletter, article or social media post.

After selecting the proper communication tool for each group, begin planning the messages for each group. Here it might be helpful to start with the broadest group and end with the most specific. For each group, aim to answer questions such as: What are the main facts that the audience needs to know? How much background does your audience already have on this topic? When will these facts need to be communicated? What is the best channel to reach the audience?

Make sure that each message is tailored to specifically cover the needs of your audience. For example, what are the absolutely necessary facts that a policy maker will need to know from your assessment to help them better manage your marine resources? How can you convey this information in the most direct, easily accessible way? This message will vastly differ from the one sent to the general public, who’s main aim will be to increase awareness of ocean health and resource management. For examples, a past Ocean Health Index Global Assessment press release can be found [here](http://www.pacificlife.com/content/dam/paclife_corp/crp/public/about_pacific_life/foundation_community/strategic_focus/healthy_oceans/081512_Ocean_Health_Index_Media_Release.pdf) and the report for policy makers from our West coast case study can be found [here](http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/Apps/OHI/Vault/Output?VaultID=7899&ts=1422972909).

It is important to remember that you may also want to include some of your stakeholders in this process. Partnering with some of your stakeholders might give you access to a broader demographic to help you amplify your message. You may also reach out to the Ocean Health Index team to collaborate on ways that they can help you amplify your message.
