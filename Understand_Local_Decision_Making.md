**Understanding Local Decision-Making Processes**

The key components of decision-making include:

- Identifying the issue
- Considering the solutions
- Assessing each solution's impact
- Implementation

In most countries, decision-makers are entrusted by their constituents to represent them and act in their best interest. This fact makes it important to translate the assessment science into accessible information and to disseminate the information through discussions with decision-makers and other stakeholders so that they can easily understand it.

It is equally important to *match the scale of the assessment to that of the decision-making,* so the Index can be used as a management tool to inform actions and policies at local scales.

Partnering with decision-makers:
- Identify types of management issues OHI will help inform.
- Identify and leverage ongoing efforts and existing partnerships or opportunities for new partnerships
- Tap into existing networks of other colleagues, etc.; figure out who would be good to work with and has the capacity to influence change within their networks/organizations
- Engage decision-makers in research, so results are relevant to their needs, thereby leading to the results being used in decision-making.
