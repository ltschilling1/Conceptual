**Why Ten Goals?** The Index did not set out to have ten goals. The process of reviewing literature and assessing management objectives resulted in ten goals, several with sub-goals that are each assessed separately. Regions in which some goals are not relevant can (and should) be assessed based only on the remaining goals. The Index is flexible to the inclusion of different or additional goals, something we have not yet encountered but is certainly possible.
