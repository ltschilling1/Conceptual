**Sense of Place**

The sense of place goal aims to capture the level of protection for aspects of the coastal and marine system that contribute to a person's sense of cultural identity. This definition includes people living near the ocean and those who live far from it but still derive a sense of identity or value from knowing particular places or species exist. Since few groups, communities or states have explicitly described the attributes of the coastal and ocean environments that have special cultural meaning, we chose the condition of iconic species and of lasting special places as proxies for how well this goal is being delivered. We focused on two components of how well people connect with the ocean: iconic species and lasting special places. the overal sense of place goal is then the arithmetic mean of the two sub-goals scores.

  - **Iconic Species**

    This sub-goal captures the species that are important to a region: iconic species are defined as those that are relevant to local cultural identity through one or more of the following: 1) traditional activities such as fishing, hunting or commerce; 2) local ethnic or religious practices; 3) existence value; and 4) locally-recognized aesthetic value.

    The intent of the iconic species sub-goal was to focus on those species widely seen as iconic within a region, and iconic from a cultural or existence value (rather than for an economic or extractive reason). Iconic species symbolize the cultureal, spiritual and aesthetic benefits that people value for a region, and are often intangible benefits to coastal communities and beyond.

    Ideally, data would be available on all species that are important to coastal communities, and then a separate assessment would judge the condition of each of the populations. Because almost any species can be iconic to someone, defining which species are culturally iconic can be challenging; information can sometimes be found from local customs and experts, oral tradition, sociological or anthropological literature, journalism and regional assessments. The type of reference point used will depend on the data available.

  - **Lasting Special Places**

    This sub-goal captures the conservation status of geographic locations that hold significant aesthetic, spiritual, cultural, recreational. or existence value for people.

    Well-maintained and protected lasting special places provide intangible but significant resources that help sustain and may also generate economic opportunities and help to sustain coastal communities, but those are captured in other goals.

    Ideally one would have (or develop) a list of all the places that people within a region consider special, and then assess what percent of and how well those areas are protected. The type of reference point used will depend on the data available.
