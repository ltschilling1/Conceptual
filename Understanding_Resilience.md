**Understanding Resilience**Resilience is the sum of the ecological factors and social initiatives (policies, laws, etc) that can positively affect goal scores by reducing or eliminating pressures. Ecological and social resilience are similarly assessed separately and then combined with equal weighting, which could also be changed based on expert opinions. Any new resilience measure must be associated wit ha pressure layer. This is because resilience in the Index framework acts to reduce pressures in each region. Therefore, resilience measures must not only be directly or indirectly relevant to ocean health, but must be in response to a pressure layer affecting a goal.Pressures and resilience are ultimately important for scores, but they have a smaller contribution to the overall scores because we can only approximate their effects. Individual pressures are ranked for their importance to different goals based on published studies and expert opinion. Resilience actions are the best way to improve a score, because they can reduce pressures, protect ocean habitats and species, improve status, and optimize benefits to people.
