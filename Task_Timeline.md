**Task Timeline**

The Task Timeline (seen below) provides the steps involved in conducting Ocean Health Index assessments as well as the suggestions of the skills involved for doing so. The process of calculating he Index is not necessarily linear: there is a lot of 'back-and-forth' in regards to making the best decisions. For example, gathering appropriate data for each gaol, pressures, and resilience requires thinking about how to calculate reference points. It is possible that data sources will need to change as the process gets further along if it becomes clear that models should be further modified.

The Task Timeline outlines three phases that occur through time. The time required will depend on the availability of data, the number of people working on the assessment, as well as challenges that may arise. Tasks are indicated by skill set but many decisions will also occur as a team.

The phases and tasks outlined in the Task Timeline are:

- **Phase 1:** Starting decisions an conceptual understanding
- **Phase 2:** Data discovery & acquisition, reference points & models, preparing data and using the Toolbox App
- **Phase 3:** Documentation & publishing, policy & communication

Further supporting documentation, including examples, will be available for many of these steps soon.
