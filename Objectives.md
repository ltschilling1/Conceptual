**Establish Your Objectives**

First, establish concrete objectives for the assessment itself: creating models, collecting and synthesizing data, analyzing spatial information, and writing programming code. Second, create short and long-term objectives highlighting intentions for the findings and iterative activities for future assessments.

Objectives refer to specific measurable results for the assessmentâ€™s broad goals. The assessment objectives describe how much of what will be accomplished by when.

The objectives should describe the future conditions after the problem has been addressed (think of the reference points), following a logical hierarchy, and illustrating their relationships with the final goal.

In defining the objectives, the team should also describe the intended strategies (the how) to reach the desired objectives. These strategies can range from the broad (stakeholder analysis) to the very specific (institutionalization of the Index).
