**Determining the Spatial Scale**

It is important to remember that the scale of assessment should match the scale of decision-making.

Most assessments focus on political boundaries, since most agencies and organizations gather and report data at this spatial scale.

Index goal scores are calculated at the scale of the reporting unit, which is called a ‘region’ and then combined using a weighted average to produce the score for the overall area assessed, called a ‘study area’.

When deciding the spatial scale of the assessments, the Working Group should consider the following:

•	At what spatial scale are most data collected?

•	What are the existing governance or political boundaries that would be relevant? (governance/decision-making boundaries are needed if the Index will be useful for management)

•	If managers and/or policy makers are interested, what needs to be measured and why? At what scale do they work?

These questions are important to keep the Index assessment relevant but ultimately data availability will be the most important factor when defining boundaries for the Index.

There is no single criterion for identifying the scale of the study area since the Index can potentially be used at all scales using data, parameters, interests, and goals at the scale of the study.
