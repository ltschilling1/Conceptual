**Understand scales of assessment: Global & Independent (OHI+)**Index scores by goal are calculated at the scale of the reporting unit, which is called a ‘region’ and then combined using a weighted average to produce the score for the overall area assessed, called a ‘study area’. In the global assessments the study are is the world and the regions assessed are coastal countries or territories (two hundred twenty one exclusive economic zones), Antarctica, and the high seas (fifteen sub divisions). Global assessments are conducted by a multidisciplinary team of scientists led by the U.S. National Center for Ecological Assessment and Synthesis (NCEAS), Conservation International, and the Seas Around Us Project. These studies are published annually and use models developed using the best existing data available a the global scale to capture each goal philosophy. At the global level, we apply the same methods and reference points to all regions assessed equally, which ensures scientific objectivity and allows for comparison of performance across countries. The methods are improved every year by increasing goal model robustness, integrating new data, and recalculating the scores with the improved methods both for the current year and, retroactively, for previous years to allow for year to year comparisons.![](./Figures/Figure_scale.png)Assessements can be carried out at different scalesStudies at smaller scales are called Ocean Health Index+ (OHI+) assessments and are conducted by independent groups that use the Index approach to measure ocean health in their regions, countries, states, and communities. These assessments can be used by managers to incorporate local information and priorities at the spatial scale where policy and management decisions are made.
