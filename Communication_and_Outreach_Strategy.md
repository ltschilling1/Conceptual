**Communications and Outreach Strategy**

Examples of how to increase your presence include:

•	Work with network of decision-makers who were part of the planning team to organize public meetings, hearing, inter-agency meetings

•	Consider perspective of the decision-maker: clarify issue and why of interest, highlight action to take and the relevant science to support the action

•	Maintain engagement in the decision-making process: councils, partnerships with stakeholders, periodic meetings with technical working groups and government agencies

•	Provide clear recommendations and courses of actions that create the conditions to sustainable maximize ocean productivity
